Arduino program with user friendly UI that sends O/I signals in a N number of pins with millisecond acurassy.Delays are fully customizable and non blocking while also retaining their values after use via arduino's EEPROM non volatile memory.
Application is meant for industrial use in machinery that requires precision without the cost of maintaining or repurchasing a factory set microcontroller.
